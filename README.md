# Instructions for Compiling and Executing the Program:

The datasets ISTD (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1I0qw-65KBA6np8vIZzO6oeiOvcDBttAY/view) should be downloaded into a dataset folder named “./datasets/” under the working directory, as “./datasets/ISTD/”.
For testing, download model in the pre-trained folder:
Pair CycleGANmodel: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G_286UJLAe35wCrWOPyDA3BomT8Zrw_w/view?usp=drive_link
Unpair model: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Pqbg9GseQts5tRwSYINUkNX0MZKdZ3id/view?usp=drive_link

Open Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/).
Upload the cycleGAN.ipynb Jupyter notebook.
Ensure that the necessary libraries and dependencies are installed. Most standard libraries are pre-installed on Google Colab.
Navigate to the cell you wish to run and click on the play button to the left of the cell or press Shift + Enter.
Execute the cells in the order they appear in the notebook for the best results.
